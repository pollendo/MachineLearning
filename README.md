## MachineLearning 
I am using this repository to give an overview of basic machine learning techniques and showcase some of the things I have learned at university.

* Project *polynomial_regression.py* is a short demonstration of underfitting and overfitting using **Linear Regression**. 
* Project *bayesian_linear_regression.py* calculates the **Predictive Distribution** using **Bayesian Linear Regression** and plots the result Variance to showcase certainty around existing data points and uncertainty elsewhere.
* Project *support_vector_machines.py* separates a data set using **Support Vector Machines** to obtain decision boundaries between the two resulting clusters. 

All projects should be easy to adapt, but at some points I assumed knowledge of the underlying formulas. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss or collaborate further on it!
