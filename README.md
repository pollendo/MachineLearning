## MachineLearning 
I am using this repository to give an overview of basic machine learning techniques and showcase some of the things I have learned at university.

* Project *polynomial_regression.py* is a short demonstration of underfitting and overfitting using **Linear Regression**. 
* Project *bayesian_linear_regression.py* calculates the **Predictive Distribution** using **Bayesian Linear Regression** and plots the result Variance to showcase certainty around existing data points and uncertainty elsewhere.

* All projects should be easy to interpret and adapt. Feel free to use this code in any way or reach out to me if you would like to discuss or collaborate further on it!
